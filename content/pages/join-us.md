## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my employer know I've joined?

No, unless you tell them. Union membership is confidential. However, we encourage members to be open about membership - there's strength in numbers!

### I'm on a zero-hours contract - can I still join?

Yes! Many of our members are freelance or on precarious contracts. That's exactly why union membership is valuable.

### What if I don't work in London anymore?

You can transfer to another NUJ branch anywhere in the UK or Ireland. We'll help facilitate the transfer.

### Can I join if I'm currently unemployed?

Yes. If you're a journalist seeking work or made recently redundant, you can join at a concessionary rate.

### I'm a student - should I join now?

Yes! Student membership is discounted and gives you access to training, networking, and job advice before you graduate.

### What if I can't afford the fees?
