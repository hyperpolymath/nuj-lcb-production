**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Status**: CRITICAL - Active far-right doxing threat

## Threat Context

### Real, Immediate Dangers

1. **Far-right groups targeting journalists and union members**
   - Doxing (publishing personal info online)
   - Harassment campaigns
   - Physical threats
   - Coordinated attacks on union organizers

2. **Member data at risk**
   - Names, addresses, phone numbers
   - Email addresses
   - Workplace information
   - Membership status
   - Payment details

3. **Attack vectors**
   - Website breaches (steal member database)
   - Social engineering
   - Phishing attacks on admins
   - Brute force password attacks
   - Exploiting WordPress vulnerabilities

## Regulatory Compliance

### Required Standards

| Authority | Requirement | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Charity Commission** | Data protection, financial transparency | ✅ Planned |
| **Certification Officer** | Member records security, union governance | ✅ Planned |
| **UK GDPR/DPA 2018** | Personal data protection, breach notification | ⚠️ Critical |
| **ICO** | Data security measures, privacy by design | ⚠️ Critical |

## CRITICAL Security Measures (Implement NOW)

### 1. Member Data Protection

#### Database Security

```yaml
CRITICAL - Implement Immediately:
  - ✅ Database encryption at rest (LUKS/dm-crypt on VPS)
  - ✅ Strong database passwords (32+ chars, random)
  - ✅ Database firewall (no external access)
  - ✅ Separate database user per service (WordPress, Zulip, Jitsi)
  - ✅ Regular encrypted backups (off-site, different provider)
  - ✅ Database audit logging
```

#### WordPress Hardening

```php
// wp-config.php - CRITICAL SECURITY

// 1. Disable file editing (prevent backdoors)
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true);

// 2. Security keys (regenerate monthly)
// Get from: https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
define('AUTH_KEY', '[REGENERATE MONTHLY]');
// ... all 8 salts

// 3. Force HTTPS everywhere
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);
define('FORCE_SSL_LOGIN', true);

// 4. Disable XML-RPC (common attack vector)
add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');

// 5. Limit login attempts
// Install plugin: Limit Login Attempts Reloaded

// 6. Hide WordPress version
remove_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator');

// 7. Disable user enumeration
// In .htaccess or server config
```

#### Password Policy

```
MANDATORY for all admins:
- ✅ Minimum 20 characters
- ✅ Argon2id hashing (if available) or bcrypt
- ✅ 2FA via authenticator app (NOT SMS)
- ✅ Password rotation every 90 days
- ✅ No password reuse (last 24 passwords)
- ✅ Bitwarden/1Password for password management
```

### 2. Access Control

#### Admin Accounts

```yaml
CRITICAL:
  - Limit admin accounts to 3 people maximum
  - Use principle of least privilege
  - Separate accounts for different roles:
    - Super Admin (1 person only)
    - Editor (content only, no plugins)
    - Author (posts only)
  - Review admin users monthly
  - Remove accounts immediately on resignation
```

#### IP Whitelisting

```nginx
# Restrict admin access to known IPs
location /wp-admin {
  allow 1.2.3.4;        # Branch office VPN
  allow 5.6.7.8;        # Chair's home IP
  deny all;
}

# Allow login from anywhere (with 2FA)
location = /wp-login.php {
  # Rate limiting only
  limit_req zone=login burst=5;
}
```

### 3. Data Minimization

#### What NOT to Store

```
❌ NEVER store in WordPress:
  - Full home addresses (store postcode only)
  - Phone numbers (use encrypted contact form)
  - Bank details (use payment processor)
  - National Insurance numbers
  - Sensitive health information
  - Political opinions beyond union membership

✅ Store only essential:
  - Name (first name + last initial for public)
  - Email (encrypted)
  - Membership number
  - Workplace (company name only, not address)
  - Membership status
```

#### Member Privacy Settings

```php
// Default ALL members to private visibility
// Only show publicly with explicit opt-in
update_option('default_comment_status', 'closed');
update_option('default_ping_status', 'closed');

// Hide member list from non-members
// Install plugin: Members (by MemberPress)
// Set member directory to "Members Only"
```

### 4. Attack Surface Reduction

#### Disable Unnecessary Features

```php
// wp-config.php

// Disable comments (reduces spam/XSS)
define('DISALLOW_COMMENTS', true);

// Disable pingbacks/trackbacks
define('WP_DISABLE_PINGBACK', true);

// Disable REST API for non-authenticated users
add_filter('rest_authentication_errors', function($result) {
  if (!is_user_logged_in()) {
    return new WP_Error(
      'rest_disabled',
      'REST API disabled for non-authenticated users',
      ['status' => 401]
    );
  }
  return $result;
});
```

#### Plugin Security

```
ONLY install plugins that are:
  ✅ Actively maintained (updated in last 6 months)
  ✅ 100,000+ active installs OR security-focused
  ✅ 4.5+ star rating
  ✅ Regular security audits

REQUIRED security plugins:
  1. Wordfence Security (free tier sufficient)
  2. Two Factor Authentication
  3. WP Activity Log (audit trail)
  4. UpdraftPlus (encrypted backups)
  5. Really Simple SSL

PROHIBITED plugins:
  ❌ Contact Form 7 (use WPForms with encryption)
  ❌ Any plugin with "nulled" or "premium free"
  ❌ Plugins not updated in 1+ year
```

### 5. Monitoring & Incident Response

#### Real-Time Alerts

```yaml
Configure alerts for:
  - Failed login attempts (>5 in 1 hour)
  - New admin user creation
  - Plugin/theme installation
  - Database exports
  - Large file uploads
  - Unusual traffic patterns

Send alerts to:
  - Branch Secretary (email + SMS)
  - Tech officer (Slack/email)
  - Wordfence security team
```

#### Breach Response Plan

```
IF member data is compromised:

IMMEDIATE (within 1 hour):
  1. Take site offline
  2. Disconnect database
  3. Preserve logs
  4. Notify National NUJ immediately

URGENT (within 24 hours):
  5. Notify ICO (UK GDPR breach reporting)
  6. Notify Certification Officer
  7. Email all members about breach
  8. Offer identity protection services

FOLLOWUP (within 72 hours):
  9. Full security audit
  10. Patch vulnerabilities
  11. Restore from clean backup
  12. Implement additional security measures
  13. Report to police if criminal activity suspected
```

### 6. Encryption Everywhere

#### In Transit

```
✅ TLS 1.3 only (disable TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)
✅ HSTS with preload
✅ Certificate pinning (for admin pages)
✅ Force HTTPS site-wide
✅ Encrypt WordPress → Database connection
```

#### At Rest

```bash
# VPS disk encryption
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 encrypted_disk

# Database encryption
# In my.cnf (MariaDB)
[mysqld]
innodb_file_per_table = 1
innodb_encrypt_tables = ON
innodb_encrypt_log = ON
innodb_encryption_threads = 4
```

#### Backups

```bash
# Encrypted backup script
#!/bin/bash
# Daily encrypted backup to off-site location

# Database dump
mysqldump --all-databases | gzip > backup.sql.gz

# Encrypt with GPG (branch secretary's public key)
gpg --encrypt --recipient secretary@nuj-lcb.org.uk backup.sql.gz

# Upload to off-site (different provider than VPS)
rclone copy backup.sql.gz.gpg backblaze:nuj-backups/

# Rotate (keep 30 days)
rclone delete backblaze:nuj-backups/ --min-age 30d
```

```

## Member Communication Security

### Secure Channels

```
For sensitive union business:

✅ Encrypted email (ProtonMail or Tutanota)
✅ Signal (for real-time chat)
✅ Zulip (self-hosted, encrypted at rest)
✅ Jitsi (self-hosted, E2EE)

❌ NEVER use:
  ❌ Unencrypted email for member lists
  ❌ Facebook groups (Meta has access)
  ❌ WhatsApp (Meta-owned)
  ❌ SMS for sensitive info
  ❌ Zoom (unless E2EE enabled)
```

## Physical Security

### VPS Provider Security

```
Choose provider with:
  ✅ UK/EU jurisdiction (GDPR compliant)
  ✅ ISO 27001 certified
  ✅ SOC 2 Type II audit
  ✅ Physical security (data center access logs)
  ✅ DDoS protection
  ✅ Backup locations in different geographic regions

Avoid:
  ❌ US-based (CLOUD Act, Patriot Act)
  ❌ Shared hosting (too many attack vectors)
  ❌ Cheap/unknown providers
```

### Access Controls

```
VPS root access:
  - SSH key only (disable password auth)
  - 2FA for SSH (Google Authenticator)
  - Fail2ban (auto-block brute force)
  - Non-standard SSH port
  - Whitelist IPs if possible
  - Log all access attempts
  - Review logs weekly
```

## Far-Right Threat Specific Measures

### Doxing Prevention

```
Public-facing content:
  - Use first names only (no surnames)
  - No home addresses
  - No personal phone numbers

  - Use stock photos instead of real offices

Contact forms:
  - Use generic email (contact@nuj-lcb.org.uk)
  - No direct officer emails on public pages
  - Use Cloudflare email protection
```

### DDoS Protection

```
Via Cloudflare:
